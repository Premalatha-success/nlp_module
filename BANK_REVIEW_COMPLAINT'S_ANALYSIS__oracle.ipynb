In the end, we were in a position to close a full week early due to the hard work Alex and his team put in._x000D_\\nWhen it came to closing and sitting down to sign all of the necessary paperwork our escrow officer commented that \\u201cThis is a great rate, you must have a friend at the Mortgage Company\\u201d?...

Then the selling realtor tried pushing us to use a local lender\\u2026.._x000D_\\nAfter our initial conversations with Alex we knew he was the broker we wanted to work with and my wife agreed so we refused to switch to a local lender and are very happy we did! Alex went above and beyond to get things done for us and was available both way before normal business hours on a morning and into the night as well, including on weekends. _x000D_\\nAs our purchase progressed, Susan\\u2019s caution changed to admiration as she complimented Alex and Pacific Beneficial to us on several occasions for their professionalism, responsiveness and commented on how easy they were making things for her on the loan side. In the end, we were in a position to close a full week early due to the hard work Alex and his team put in._x000D_\\nWhen it came to closing and sitting down to sign all of the necessary paperwork our escrow officer commented that \\u201cThis is a great rate, you must have a friend at the Mortgage Company\\u201d?...

In the end, we were in a position to close a full week early due to the hard work Alex and his team put in._x000D_\\nWhen it came to closing and sitting down to sign all of the necessary paperwork our escrow officer commented that \\u201cThis is a great rate, you must have a friend at the Mortgage Company\\u201d?...

              "'great job, wyndham capital! each person was professional and helped us move through our refinance process smoothly. thank you! matthew richardson is professional and helpful. he helped us find the correct product for our mortgage. thank you very much for the excellent service, matthew! we had a past experience with wyndham mortgage and would without question use again and again if needed!! wyndham went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money. we would highly recommend brad thomka and the wyndham capital mortgage team for your mortgage needs. sincerest thanks wyndham!! ed & lind we have been dealing with brad thomka from the beginning of what started out to be a very stressful time for us, but with the help from brad and the entire wyndham mortgage team it was turned into a happy ending!! brad and wyndham went beyond the extra mile to not only right a wrong encountered from the servicer we were dealing on our previous loan, but they pulled together and found a viable option for us that ultimately saved us money. we are indebted and would highly recommend brad thomka and the wyndham capital mortgage team for your mortgage needs. sincerest thanks wyndham!! ed & lindread less i can\\'t express how grateful i am for the support that zach provided to me and my family during this home purchase! his customer service, responsiveness and professional demeanor is second to none. he was very thorough and took the time to educate me about the process along the way. i highly recommend working with zach and wyndham capital! i had the pleasure of working with wyndham capital in september 2018 as my family and i were making a home purchase in columbus, oh. from the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing, the entire team from wyndham was very responsive and professional. i was very impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying (and selling) can be my experience with mattison was beyond greatly professionally done!! she really cares about her clients needs! she stays on top of everything and if there was a misunderstanding, she would be on top of it for you. overall she truly bends her back professionally for her clients. she is a wonderful person! patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure i got the right loan for my situation. the portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with 2 weeks. very pleased with the customer service and intend on using patrick again when we refinance later!!!! i loved working with this group of people! they laughed with me over the phone! always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible! knowledgeable staff! while we were shopping around for a lender, one lender badmouthed wyndham, they lost my business because of it. when i told wyndham about it, they had the class not to say anything negative about another company, just to get the \"sell\" great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features. quick responses to any questions or concerns. willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email...as phone calls weren\\'t always an option for us. working with michelle and wyndham went really well for me. as a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance, i feel that this process was smooth and successful. i will definitely recommend michelle to friends and family. usten butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and i will ever make. we didn\\'t simply want to transact with a faceless institution. a lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. austen was there for us, every step of the way. it\\'s true. austen got us the best deal. yes, that\\'s also true. but it\\'s more than that. from when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. it\\'s made a huge difference for our family, we\\'re right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn\\'t be happier - and it\\'s all thanks to austen butler\\'s help. jay was easy to get a hold of if i had any questions so that was huge to me because there\\'s a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything\\'s right. he provided as great a service as i could\\'ve wanted if i had a million friends i would recommend all of them to wyndham capital especially to mark taylor he’s great he really help with even of the clock thanks a million mark i mean that from heart i appreciate everything you did for me. chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs. i had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues i had. he was the glue that kept this deal together. i did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end. again, cannot say enough positive things about chaz. consummate professional and very responsive. i would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunities austen has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase. he explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the b.s other companies use to get your business . being a repeat customer says it all. the salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him i\\'m looking for a heloc specifically. then he hangs up on me because i said i was quoted a better rate at td bank. ridiculous.... this was the worst experience ever. it was like they had never gone through the process before. i could not get a complete list of the documents required. every other day it was a new request. the appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes i had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections. wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again. there were many documents that i had to send 3 and 4 times because they \"lost\" them or was not filed correctly, we went through 4 different people through the process. i would never use them. awful experience! a good rate but a very frustrating process, constant delays, decisions made then changed, overwhelmed underwriting team with 3 week back log, rookie mistake related to texas law that caused an additional 2 week wait. closing happened almost 6 weeks after it should have. courteous and professional, but not very knowledgeable and no sense of urgency. would not recommend they were not upfront. learn from my mistake... i trusted the loan officer that my zero point rate is an option before closing the loan because he convinced me to initially sign the good faith estimate with higher rate plus lender\\'s credit. after running my numbers, the lower interest is favorable for me and asking for it now, i\\'m being charge points. it looks like they are only good in their words at the beginning so please be careful dealing with this lender initially, the mortgage broker was very friendly and assertive. once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent, it became increasingly difficult to reach the broker. i had to initiate all phone calls. it seemed as if i had to call to make the process move forward. it took four weeks to get a copy of my closing documents and the payoff for my credit card initially, the mortgage broker was very friendly and assertive. once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent,

ours was a complicated process with a refinance and a loan and they hung in there with us the entire time. it was a great experience working with both of them. i highly recommend them and will use them in the future for all of my mortgage needs kory was by far the best loan officer i have ever worked with. we were dealing with a complicated refinance and purchase of two different properties and he was cool, calm, professional and extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire process. i wouldn’t use anyone else moving forward. his level of integrity and responsiveness is second to none. thanks for everything, kory expert loan officer, well versed in va and the financial impacts of loan component changes. the best i have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. she places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded nasb team (also stellar!) to support your needs. he handled my complicated va loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). everything along the way mattered and aaron and the nasb team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. look, do not pass up an opportunity to work with him. the nasb team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important va home loan on time despite many changes, my military retirement, and a very challenging antebellum home that required the entire nasb team to pull out all the stops, know the rules and regulations, and guide us through a tough va process. i truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team. i will only recommend nasb for home loans...especially complicate va loans dallas goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you. he was as professional as they come and closed our loan in 12 days. we were with another competitor originally and he called, saving us thousands over our current lender. it was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like dallas. great job! comments: to begin my wife and i were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service. we were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. several lender matched or slightly beat nasb but none were convincing at closing on time. we chose nasb because of dallas goodlet believability on the closing. the sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful. dallas goodlet/ brent custer and the whole nasb team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised. we are completely satisfied and appreciative of the staff, product and service of your company. kudos to all working with jon was such an amazing experience! from the start he offered answers to any questions i had since after all this was our first home purchase! jon was always a phone call away ready to help where needed. he made the stringent home buying process as easy as possible! i would definitely recommend any potential buyers to work with jon, i know for myself i will be calling him if we ever decide to buy another house! thanks jon nasb was amazing to work with! the pre-approval process was easy and informational. we chose our home and closed within 30 days of our agreement date! thanks nasb for making our first home purchase an amazing experience! jon barrett was a great asset to my husband and i. he made our mortgage loan process extremely simple and quick! jon was knowledgeable, helpful, patient and accurate. we will be passing jon\\'s name along to anyone looking for a mortgage loan! i can\\'t express how incredibly awesome our experience was with working with bryant small at nasb. as a military family, we have purchased or refinanced many homes and this was by far the best experience we have ever had. bryant makes it easy and took the time to discuss the best options for us. i\\'ve never met bryant, but you can\\'t mistake authenticity and we knew instantly he and nasb were who we were going with. best loan officer i could have hoped for! jeff exceeded my expectations. he worked very hard to get me the best rate possible. highly recommended adam was great to work with during our refi! his attention to detail made this a smooth and easy transaction. it has been several years since we\\'ve gone thru the home loan process and we were unsure where to start. after talking with adam, we were confident he was the one to help us with our refi. he was professional, helpful, very knowledgeable about the loan process and answered all of our questions in a timely manner. i would highly recommend adam and would not hesitate to work with him agai great website, knowledgeable, responsive and always got back to us quickly with answers to our questions. mortgage process can be very tedious and they made it easy. we received offers from multiple banks after our lending tree request for a mortgage. alex madewell from nasb was by far the best offer. he made the entire process easy and was very knowledgeable. the closing on this home was seamless, no surprises. i would definitely recommend alex madewell and nasb to anyone looking for a mortgage. rob was very helpful in getting this loan closed. few issues on our end we didn\\'t know about but he was still able to get it done on time. peter and his team were great to work with. they were professional and prompt with their responses. they answered all my questions and somehow got us to closing on time despite various roadblocks we encountered. adam came highly recommended and from the first time we spoke with him, it was clear why. he was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and worked hard to ensure we were taken care of in all aspects. beyond the necessary effective communication skills, he brought a personal touch after we closed by sending us a hand written note of congratulations. i will recommend him to everyone i know buying a house. the closing process for a va loan went smoothly. but the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster. i set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. unlike other banks with which i do business, the nasb website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. for the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. however, when the escrow amount changed, nasb debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank i have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. nasb sent me a \"credit counseling letter\" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. when i called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. two weeks later, i received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from nasb\\'s default department. the woman with whom i first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. the second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that i had made any automatic payments and that nasb\\'s system was not set up to adjust anything. after having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, i have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. i specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran miserable experience. they screwed up everything imaginable and never accepted responsibility for any of their errors. i wouldnt recommend them for the purchase of a doghouse much less purchasing a new home. our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed. once we committed he only communicated with us after i questioned items and problems and after i questioned why we weren\\'t settling before our rate lock expired. we had no idea where we were in the process unless i contacted steve. poor, poor communication. mr. kang also was \"sure\" our house would appraise for $30k more than our house did, talking us into a loan that we didn\\'t end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only .4% lower than our current mortgage. our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot. he used poor comps. we were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on (within minutes of the email notifications). only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary (and thank goodness we were done). poor process, poor communication - we will never recommend nasb and i have already told two people refinancing to steer clear. started refinance with nick things were going ok then there was a problem with a credit card fro 5 years earlier, which must of made the loan not possible. this i would of understood, but i never heard from them again? called nick several times no response? i even called his supervisor no response? e-mailed them no response? is this the company you want to due busness... this loan started off quite well. our rep, donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. she clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. what i didn\\'t count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made. i had the same problem with this bank 15 or more times. i would ask for assurance about something, donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished, and her promise was violated by the bank every single time. for example, in our first or second conversation, i explained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? not at all, she said. we should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the bank was not ready to close. how did that happen? donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the bank had everything it needed. then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. this happened 5 or more times. later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now \"too old.\" i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. we finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. this bank treats customers with complete disrespect. as someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, i can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience i\\'ve ever had. you owe it to yourself to work with another bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. if i could, i\\'d rate this bank lower than one star this lender contacted my previous phone number which i did not list when registering with this site. very unprofessional, and very disturbing. i never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as i. that mistake was using north american savings bank over other lenders. i started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. communication with the company w... it all started when bob g ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. when i agreed to use nasb, bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. the day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. the day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) i was told a power of attorney could not be used. i had to fly to id (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and fedex them back. i also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn\\'t accept a personal check. then five days later (while driving from id to nc) i had to coordinate having closing docs (which i already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so i could send to them. of the four houses i purchased in the past 9 years this was the most stressful read less what a horrible experience. we have excellent credit, plenty of income, etc. nasb rep made tons of promises to get us to sign up, but then just a few weeks before the closing, she just disappeared, and failed to give us a lock or firm closing date! thankfully, we sensed the problems and immediately contacted a local lender that got us the loan on better terms with low... rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. in fact, from my initial round of calls, i thought i was going to select him out of the five lending tree lenders (plus two banks i talked to directly). but then when i sent an email to all the lenders saying \"ok, the contract is signed. i want to select a lender and lock my rate tomorrow, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these exact loan parameters. it took the rep from nasb over a week to respond. so i replied to him \"thanks but you are too late, i have selected someone else and already locked my rate.\" over the following few weeks i continued to receive emails from him saying \"when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know\". we closed on january 8th, and on february 5th i got another such email. i guess he didn\\'t really ever read my emails. i also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too. at the end of round one, his rates and fees were very competitive though - pretty near the best of the bunch i was working with a loan consultant from nasb and she told me that she would give me a rate of 4.875% for a 30 year fixed loan with a total closing cost of $2300. i asked her to send me the good faith estimate. the good faith estimate came with a total closing cost of $2929 which is about $600 more than she mentioned during our conversation. when i called her for

irs send us the transcript of it, and sent it via po, and electronically. but then it was held up for 3 weeks because the transcript was mailed by us, and not the irs. now we are getting ridiculous. so we had the irs fax it to them directly, and still they had a problem with it\\'s \"authenticity\". they received everything we had, with no discrepancies, yet the loan mgr suggested we go ahead and \"dummy up\" a copy, as long as it would match exactly. we said no, the two separate transcripts were accurate, and they could use those, or we would walk. amazing that a week later they finally approved it. this guy had emailed and called every day, sometimes as many as 4 times, even during our christmas trip to dallas, only to sit and wait, and wonder what the black hole was doing. and to make it more annoying, he had a demeaning way of speaking, saying \"does that make sense?\", after every statement, as if i couldn\\'t understand basic english. one of those things people say when

lendingtree which is how kirk contacted me. my original lender had offered to pay for my home appraisal in writing, and, wanting to compete, kirk said he would pay for the appraisal (which he stated in writing) and asked for the letter the other lender had provided so he could get permission to have pacific beneficial pay for my appraisal. kirk confirmed i would not be paying for the appraisal and was very happy with what kirk was doing to accommodate me as a customer. however, when i closed on the home, the cost of the appraisal was on my final buyer’s statement ($525). as kirk had said that i would not be paying for the appraisal, i thought i would be reimbursed. i reached out to kirk via email after close and got no further response than “we paid for appraisal upfront but we get reimbursed.” i then reached out to kirk two times via email with no response. i then called the office and spoke to kirk’s boss’ admin who instructed me to reach out to kirk’s boss, adam carrion, which i did. it was only then that i received an email response from kirk stating that the lender credit i received, which was less than the appraisal, was all i would receive to cover the cost, despite the fact that when i was entering into the loan kirk told me that pacific beneficial would be paying for the appraisal and i would be receiving a lender credit. kirk asked me to call him, which i did and left a voicemail, and he never called me back. i called kirk again leaving a voicemail with no response. i then began reaching out to his boss adam carrion via email to continue to explain the situation. only then did i receive an email from kirk asking me to call him, which i did, left a voicemail, and received no response. i then called adam and spoke to him on the phone and only then did i receive a call from kirk, offering me a nominal amount of money. i stated that i wanted to be reimbursed for the entire appraisal amount and he said he would go back to the powers that

what i didn\\'t count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made. i had the same problem with this bank 15 or more times. i would ask for assurance about something, donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished, and her promise was violated by the bank every single time. for example, in our first or second conversation, i explained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? not at all, she said. we should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the bank was not ready to close. how did that happen? donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the bank had everything it needed. then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. this happened 5 or more times. later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now \"too old.\" i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. we finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. this bank treats customers with complete disrespect. as someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, i can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage

disturbing._x000d_ _x000d_ i never write reviews but had to this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as i. that mistake was using north american savings bank over other lenders. i started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. communication with the company was below average after i confirmed that i would be pursuing a loan with them. i had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. the company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn\\'t. this led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. after having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. when i was able to reach the loan officer i was told that i would personally have to find additional comps in my area. i was more than a little annoyed as this is what i was going to be paying them for, however i complied. after contacting area realtors and securing what i believe were suitable comps i forwarded them to the officer. a week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. at that time i was told that my comps weren\\'t sufficient and as a result they couldn\\'t ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment\\'s findings. as a result they would not be issuing me a loan. by the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. i should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. he did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. i\\'m now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that i can\\'t use. in other words i will have to pay for a new assessment. i\\'m also out the money for credit reports and of course i\\'ll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan i secure. i was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money i had spent. i expect to be paying for my mistake for years. i should point out that i refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. i strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass north american

currently owed property taxes as a prepaid for immediate disbursement to the county but trying to collect it at closing rolling it into the initial escrow account to be paid in december just a month later during the time nasb intended to sell the mortgage. thankfully this was corrected by the closing agent._x000d_ 3. mr. owens not being straight with us about nasb\\'s intent to sell the mortgage after closing. his statements of first saying nasb would not consider a sale and intended to keep the mortgage on its books then after the statement it would be sold appeared in the loan estimate saying a sale was not definite but only there \"just in case it had to be sold sometime in the future.\" since today, just 5 days after disbursement, i find out that our mortgage is on the books for immediate sale shows mr. owens likely knew of a definite sale and tried to mislead us by saying it wasn\\'t definite. _x000d_ 4. taking 4 calendar days to address errors and issues in the initial closing document which prevented us from knowing the amount we were financing and the amount we needed to pay at closing which was supposed to be made through a certified check until 15 minutes prior

called to check status 2 to 2 1/2 weeks prior. at that point i was told that everything was good to go and just waiting on the appraisal. i live in hawaii and buying here means that there is a 4 day lag time from when you sign to when the closing is actual. the items she was demanding would take 10-14 business days to get and i had already purchased my airline ticket, shipped my vehicle and

quite well. our rep, donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. she clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. what i didn\\'t count on was that the bank never kept a single promise she made. i had the same problem with this bank 15 or more times. i would ask for assurance about something, donna would respond that things would be completed as i wished, and her promise was violated by the bank every single time. for example, in our first or second conversation, i explained to donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? not at all, she said. we should close several weeks before my wife\\'s departure. 11 weeks later, the bank was not ready to close. how did that happen? donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the bank had everything it needed. then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. this happened 5 or more times. later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had i provided was now \"too old.\" i cannot tell if this patterns recured because the bank doesn\\'t care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn\\'t kept, donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. but she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. we finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. i can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn\\'t pushed hard to get this deal done. this bank treats customers with complete disrespect. as someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, i can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience i\\'ve ever had. you owe it to yourself

this time to prevent anyone from making the same mistake as i. that mistake was using north american savings bank over other lenders. i started my refinance with this company with the assurance that it would be a standard refinance without any problems and would be completed in a minimal amount of time. communication with the company was below average after i confirmed that i would be pursuing a loan with them. i had the impression that the loan officer was more interested in attracting more business than helping me. the company uses a convoluted email system that sometimes worked but mostly didn\\'t. this led to frequent emails and phone calls asking for documents to be resent. after having an assessment done on my house and paying for it the communication all but stopped. when i was able to reach the loan officer i was told that i would personally have to find additional comps in my area. i was more than a little annoyed as this is what i was going to be paying them for, however i complied. after contacting area realtors and securing what i believe were suitable comps i forwarded them to the officer. a week went by before my phone calls and emails were answered. at that time i was told that my comps weren\\'t sufficient and as a result they couldn\\'t ensure that my residence was worth anything despite the assessment\\'s findings. as a result they would not be issuing me a loan. by the time they decided to do me the honor of informing me of this the rates had risen by a half point. i should warn that the loan officer had a way of recording voicemail messages and forwarding them to my voicemail account without calling me. he did this when he had bad news and i feel like it was an effort to avoid conversing with me. i\\'m now stuck with a $450 assessment that other banks are telling me that i can\\'t use. in other words i will have to pay for a new assessment. i\\'m also out the money for credit reports and of course i\\'ll be paying a higher interest rate on any new loan i secure. i was told by the loan officer that there was no recourse to recoup the money i had spent. i expect to be paying for my mistake for years. i should point out that i refinanced my loan one year ago without any issues. i strongly urge anyone looking to refinance or obtain a new loan to bypass north american savings bank no matter what they promise. save yourself

select a lender and lock my rate tomorrow, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these exact loan parameters. it took the rep from nasb over a week to respond. so i replied to him \"thanks but you are too late, i have selected someone else and already locked my rate.\" over the following few weeks i continued to receive emails from him saying \"when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know\". we closed on january 8th, and on february 5th i got another such email. i guess he didn\\'t really ever read my emails. i also told him on the phone that he had missed

said that there is a state tax 545.10 which she was not aware of. what an explanation!!!! she knew my state from the beginning and i repeatedly asked her for a \\'total\\' closing cost and that time she repeatedly said it will be $2300. as a loan consultant she should have known that there is something like a \\'state tax\\' that might come later and should have mentioned that to me. i am not

One huge error was the Loan Estimate had rolled in initial escrow funding into the loan amount when we expressly communicated at the beginning that we did not want to finance it but pay for it at closing from available funds.
